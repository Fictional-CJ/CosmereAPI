# CosmereAPI
A minecraft mod that aims to implement a global system for cosmere-based mods to utilise

*THIS HAS NO ETA.* I will make it at some point, whether soon or whether in years, but since it's my first mod I have to learn how to mod first. I will most likely start with fabric, due to it being easier and all of the cosmere mods existing for forge, but in the future I may learn both and develop the API on both.
